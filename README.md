# NSS-DDA5-Capstone

Capstone project for Nashville Software School Data Analytics 5th Cohort by Andrea Anderson Doyle

The world is at times dangerous for members of minority communities. I will look at available hate crimes statistics and housing data to help determine what parts of the United States that a member of a minority community can choose to live in based on the cost of housing in that area/an individuals budget.

Motivation:

As a member of the LGBTQ+ community I have to consider my safety regularly when doing most normal tasks. One day I want to move from my current residence and having an idea of the safest places I can live and afford to live there is a major factor in that decision. I’d like to have a handy tool to help myself and others make these decisions.

Data Question:

What is the safest area of the country I can live in and afford? How much is a home in the safest communities in the country?
